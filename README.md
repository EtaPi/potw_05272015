Alice and Bob are playing a game.  They are teammates, so they will win or lose together.  Before the game starts, they can talk to each other and agree on a strategy. 

When the game starts, Alice and Bob go into separate soundproof rooms – they cannot communicate with each other in any way. 

They each flip a coin and note whether it came up Heads or Tails.  (No funny business allowed – it has to be an honest coin flip and they have to tell the truth later about how it came out.) 

Now Alice writes down a guess as to the result of Bob’s coin flip; and Bob likewise writes down a guess as to Alice’s flip.

If either or both of the written-down guesses turns out to be correct, then Alice and Bob both win as a team.  But if both written-down guesses are wrong, then they both lose.


The Problem is: is there any strategy they can agree on to always win? If so, what is it?
